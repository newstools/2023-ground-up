About 50 people, mostly women, marched from the Dunoon taxi rank to Parklands on Friday. Marchers included members of community organisation’s including Ilitha LaBantu from Gugulethu, Khumbulani from Khayelitsha, Dunoon Women for Gender Equity, and Thethanathi Mngani from Witsand in Atlantis.
The group’s motorcade was accompanied by police and law enforcement officers. During the march, they handed out pamphlets about the organisations and the services offered for victims of abuse.
To the tune of Bob Marley’s ‘Three Little Birds’ playing on the speakers, a man leading the march shouted slogans such as: “Men who are not embarrassed and have sexual intercourse with our children must leave Dunoon”, and “Down with sexual predators in Dunoon.”
Secretary for the Dunoon Women and Gender Equity, Nomvuso Mukumela, said they want to create awareness about gender-based violence and tell people about their organisations which offer help.
Mukumela said she urged people to report cases of gender-based violence to the police. She said the police had told them women often withdraw cases, making it difficult to arrest perpetrators. “We want them [Parklands residents] to know that we are aware of what is happening there,” said Mukumela.
Nolufefe Mbombo from Thethanathi Mngani, an organisation in Witsand, said she wants government to take a harsher stance on dealing with perpetrators of sexual abuse and violence.
